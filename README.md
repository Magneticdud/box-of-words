# Box Of Words

BoxOfWords is a handheld, cigarette-box sized electronics project for improvisational theater practitioners.
The purpose of the project is to offer randomized word suggestions during an improv workshop or a training session.

BoxOfWords has a memory card reader, control buttons and a small LCD screen. The improviser selects his preferred word file (emotions, locations, professions...)
and can call up new randomized suggestions to the LCD screen with a press of a button.

The project was built as a present to [Trent Pancy](http://http://www.trentasaurus.com/), the organizer of the [Third Annual Finland International Improv Festival](finlandimprovfestival.com).

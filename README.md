# Box Of Words

This is a fork of [BoxOfWords](https://github.com/anroots/box-of-words) which is a handheld, cigarette-box sized electronics project for improvisational theater practitioners.

I will use an [Adafruit Data Logger Shield](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-data-logger-shield), meaning A4 and A5 are used for the RTC, and D10,D11,D12,D13 are used for the SD card

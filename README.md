# Box Of Words

BoxOfWords is a handheld, cigarette-box sized electronics project for improvisational theater practitioners.
The purpose of the project is to offer randomized word suggestions during an improv workshop or a training session.

![Finished project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anroots/box-of-words/master/build_photos/finished_small.jpg)

BoxOfWords has a memory card reader, control buttons and a small LCD screen. The improviser selects his 
preferred word file (emotions, locations, professions...) and can call up new randomized suggestions
to the LCD screen with a press of a button.

The project was built as a present to [Trent Pancy](http://http://www.trentasaurus.com/), the organizer of the [Third Annual Finland International Improv Festival](http://finlandimprovfestival.com).
